/** The reason-react-navigation bindings haven't implemented setParams yet I had to spin some up to ge this demo done. If you look at the js version above, it calls setParams which takes a json object with a key and a value. In keeping with how the bindings are written, we can reproduce the passed in value using bucklescripts object creation method. That is what I did below in the reason example. I messed with it for a bit, unsuccessfully, before I jumped into the reason-discord channel and asked the question. John Jackson the author of the ReasonML chess game coronate chimes in wiht the link to the bucklescript docs. This worked immediately. The problem now is getting this one function to work with the reason-react-navigation bindings we are using for all these demos. I ended up creating a module NavUtils.re with two lines of code. An include reference to the ReactNavigation.Navigation module which copies every thing from that module to the current one. So in the end, we have all of ReactNavigation.Navigation plus our new setParams function. You can apparently, now use either NavUtils or ReactNavigation.Navigation interchangeably. */

include ReactNavigation.Navigation;

[@bs.send] external setParams: (t, Js.t({..})) => unit = "setParams";
